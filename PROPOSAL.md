I will be creating a third-person shooter. 
I have background knowledge playing CS:GO.

By the end of Week 1, I hope to have implemented the physics of the game, such as shooting things. By the end of Week 2,
I hope that I will have implemented the movement. I probably will not make a game where the Player will freely move
around. The game will just automatically move forward by itself. 

If I finish the project early, I will implement Player movement and health bars for the enemies.
