I will be creating a third-person shooter. I have background knowledge playing CS:GO, GTA V, and Skyrim.

Timeline:

Week1: Implement the physics of the game, such as movement. Figure out the shading.

Week2: Implement the ability to shoot things. 

Week3: Implement a score system and start menu. 

If I finish the project early, I will implement health bars.
