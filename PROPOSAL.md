Put your final project proposal here.

I will be creating a simple first person shooter. This will be tricky since Cinder is in 2d and I will make this in 3d. 
I have background knowledge playing CS:GO so I know how the game should look like 
in the end. 

By the end of Week 1, I hope to have implemented the physics of the game, such as shooting things. By the end of Week 2,
I hope that I will have implemented the movement. I probably will not make a game where the player will freely move
around. The game will just automatically move forward by itself. 

If I finish the project early, I will implement player movement and health bars for the enemies.
